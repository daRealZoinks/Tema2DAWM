# LaboratorAPI

ASP.NET Core 6 API Created for my DAWM class.
It's a simple API that allows you to manage a list of students and their grades.
It has authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
You will need to provide your own SQL Server connection string in the [AppDbContext.cs](DataLayer\AppDbContext.cs#L10) file (I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was doing).

## A message for my teachers:
